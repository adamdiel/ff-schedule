# ff-schedule

Just a tool to help verify a FF football schedule is correct with divisions to help facilitate a rivalry week manually.

I'm writing this because we started the season before we could fix the schedule to include a rivalry week and we need to manually adjust the schedule the rest of the way out. 

Simply enter in your league ID into the script and run it. It will print out any matchups that are wrong and total number of matchups they currently have.

Its hacky but it worked while I manually moved things around until it returned clean.

Side note - the league needs to be public for this to work. There is a way to do it with cookies that is outlined in the following resources
